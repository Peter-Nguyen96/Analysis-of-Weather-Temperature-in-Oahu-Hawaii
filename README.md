Analysis of Weather Temperature in Oahu, Hawaii

Purpose: The purpose of this analysis was to analyze weather temperature in the month of June and December in the years 2010 to 2012 in Oahu, Hawaii in order to determine if a year round ice cream business is a viable option.  Weather data the hotest month (June) where ice cream sales would peak was compared against weather data in the coldest month (December) in order to determine if the weather in December was still appropriate for the sale of ice cream.

Results: The following are key differences in the temperature data observed in June and December at Oahu, Hawaii in 2010-2012.
1) The average temperature dropped from 74.9F to 71.0F (23.8C to 21.7C)
2) Minimum temperature is much lower in December at 56.0F (13.3C) compared to June where the lowest temperature was 64.0F (16.8F)
3) There are fewer data points available for December (1517) compared to June (1700)

Summary:
Based on temperature alone the ice cream business appears to be viable year round.  The average temperature only dropped a few degrees, indicating that on average the weather remained relatively stable, and sufficiently high enough (above 20.0C) for ice cream sales.  Although the minimum temperature in December may be considered too cold for ice cream, based on the 25%, 50%, and 75% quartile temperatures, the weather for the most part still remained fairly stable, and above 20.0C.  Temperature highs in december were also very high with a max of 83.0F (28.3C) which is still great ice cream weather.  However, temperature should not be the only weather factor that determines viability of an ice cream business.  As a case study, Bang Bang Ice Cream & Bakery in Toronto, Ontario has maintained operation year round as an ice cream business for many years despite temperature regularly plumetting below -4.0F (-20.0C). Other considerations as precipitation could influence whether people go outside and thus contribute to walk-in traffic.

Average Precipitation June/December (Presumably in inches/day)

The amount of precipitation per day in Oahu in December is slightly elevated in volume, however the change in amount, and the frequency (given the 25% and 50% quartiles) is a negligable increase and should not significantly affect ice cream sales. 

Extremely hot days are generally considered to range from 90F to 105F (32.2C to 40.6C) for many states, however according to the Honolulu, HI - National Weather Service, the hot season lasts 3.6 months from June 27th to October 14th where the average daily high is 87F and low of 76F (30.6C - 24.4C).  Considering this, a query was conducted to determine the number of days where the temperature exceeds the average daily low of the hot season in June and December which should indicate days with exceptionally high sales volume.  Since the number of entries available for June compared to December are different, the count was also normalized against entries available (count above 76F / total temp counts in month). 46.5% of days in June can be considered exceptionally hot days, compared to only 10.7% in December!  This indicates that temperature dependent days where extremely high temperatures may drive additional sales decreases in december but still occur.

In conclusion, although weather conditions condusive towards ice cream sales decreases in December compared to June in Oahu, Hawaii.  The relatively moderate and stable climate makes a year round ice cream sales operation a viable business.
